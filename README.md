##Description

This application is developed to help create a password with upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
Why can this be useful, sometimes it is hard to make a password and you don't want every password toy use to be the same. So this application makes it easy ans simple with letting you select what characters you want in your password and its length.

##Installation

I submitted URL's of the deployed application
Deployed application: http://127.0.0.1:5555/02-Challenge/Develop/index.html

##Usage

When you are on the webpage with the deployed application, click on the generate password button. 
It will then display a pop up asking how many characters you would like the passowrd to be.
It can only be 8-128 characters long.
After a proper length is submitted it wil now ask what characters you would like the password to contain.
You have to choose one or it'll take you back to the beginning.
After all the pop ups are answered it will then generate a password in the box "Your Secure Password".
